# Tournament-Tracker
This is a C#(.NET) Windows form application where you can host  a Tournament depending on number of Teams entering ,Entry fee,Winner prize etc.
After that the Tournament Logic is fairly simple it finds out the number of rounds each team has to play and the winner advances to the next round.
The winner can be choosen two ways depending on the user as it can be modified in the app.config file i.e greater score or lesser score wins.
The data of the Tournament  can be stored in Two methods:
   1.SQL Database(I have used MSSQL Database)
   2.CSV files
and because of that we can load back our tournaments and access data of the available Tournaments.

I will soon add a demo and add few more features like emailing the team memebers for their next matchups etc.


                                 Until then Peace Out!!!
